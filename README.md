# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

I've made mods to make this less lazy-y and to control it more (following mostly the Vimeagan).  Basically JUST using LazyVim as a plugin manager, Mason as an LSP manager, and not doing much else.
